# Chinese Caligraphy Vectorization (CCV) Project

## Objective

- Transfer famous Chinese caligraphy works to vector graphics, and establish a library
- Develop interesting applications based on the library

# Method of vectorization

The method I employ is as follows:

- find a high-resolution bitmap of the caligraphy work
- crop the bitmap into small bitmaps each contains a character
- vectorize each character bitmap by the aid of some software (I use [Inkscape](www.inkscape.org)) and save it to svg file

It should be noted that the vectorization process has no rigid or unique rule to follow. It is a physical yet artistic job, and no "best" result exists. The ambiguous edges should be decide objectively.

# What is finished about the library

From 2008 to 2009, I vectorized many characters in ["兰亭集序"](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%98%AD%E4%BA%AD%E9%9B%86%E5%BA%8F).

## Application

- Calligraphy copybook. I write a app to re-typeset the characters to produce a copybook of the caligraphy, as shown above.
